# homeworkTwo
Second homework project for web dev bootcamp
Portfolio showcasing upcoming development projects.
Basic flex website layout consisting of card elements with seperate label elements.
Link section in fixed header will link to each section of page.
Each picture will in the future link to a seperate website but for now I will link to a random page

First inital working out basic outline, working on practicing flex for card elements.
Second Commit, trouble shot flexbox and fine tuned layout. Got objects to position I am fairly happy with.
Third commit, lots of styling updates!Nearly finalized appearance turning in for hw tonight but will continue styling to really fine-tune the details and add websites as I create them. (Last commit will possibly add styling to footer/header links and add website link to pictures
